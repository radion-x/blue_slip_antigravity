# Pink Slips in NSW Australia: Complete Guide

## What is a Pink Slip?

A pink slip, officially known as an **eSafety Inspection Report**, is a safety inspection report that certifies your vehicle is roadworthy and meets NSW safety standards. While historically the documents were printed on pink paper (hence the name), they are now issued electronically and sent directly to Transport for NSW.

The pink slip verifies that your vehicle is safe and legally allowed to be registered in NSW. It confirms that all major safety components of your vehicle meet the minimum standards required for road use.

### Alternative Names

- eSafety Check

## Pink Slip Validity Period

### How Long is a Pink Slip Valid?

A pink slip in NSW is **valid for 6 months from the date of inspection**. This is the official validity window for registration purposes.

### The 42-Day Registration Window

While a pink slip is valid for 6 months, the **42-day window** is frequently referenced as the recommended timeframe to complete your registration renewal. This is designed to:
- Allow time for the inspection report to be electronically lodged with Transport for NSW
- Provide time to organise and pay for registration renewal
- Allow time for minor repairs if needed, then re-inspection
- Ensure smooth processing without complications

### Important Validity Rules

| Scenario | Status |
|---|---|
| Registration renewed within 6 months | ✅ Pink slip remains valid |
| Registration renewed after 6 months expires | ❌ New pink slip required |
| Registration lapsed, renewed within 3 months | ✅ May be valid if pink slip still within 6 months |
| Registration lapsed over 3 months | ❌ New pink slip required |
| Blue slip obtained (unregistered vehicles) | Valid for 42 days for first registration |

### What Happens If Your Pink Slip Expires?

If your pink slip expires before you renew your registration:
- You must obtain a new inspection
- You will need to pay the inspection fee again
- Your vehicle must pass the inspection again
- Registration cannot be renewed without a valid pink slip

---

## What Happens If Your Vehicle Fails?

### Failure Process

If your vehicle fails the pink slip inspection, you will **not receive a pink slip report**. Instead, you will receive a **"Repairs Needed" report** that lists all safety issues that must be addressed.

### Timeline for Repairs

**Within 14 Days: Free Re-Inspection**
- If you complete repairs and return to the **same authorised inspection station within 14 days**, you usually will not have to pay an additional inspection fee
- The re-inspection is typically provided at no cost
- This 14-day window is designed to encourage prompt repairs

**After 14 Days: Paid Re-Inspection**
- If repairs are completed after the 14-day period expires, the failure report expires
- You will need to pay for a new inspection
- The vehicle must pass the inspection again

### After Passing Re-Inspection

Once your vehicle passes the re-inspection:
- The inspection provider will electronically send the passed report to Transport for NSW
- You can then proceed to renew your registration
- You must renew registration within the 6-month validity period
